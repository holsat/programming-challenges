# Factoring

Factoring, or factorizing, is the decomposition of an object (such as a number, polynomial, or matrix) into a product of other objects that when multiplied produce the original object. One use for factoring is to identify whether or not a number is prime. Large prime numbers form the basis for [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which is critical to securing data transmissions over public networks such as the internet. If a method of rapidly factoring large numbers were to be developed, public-key cryptography as it exists today would be severely compromised.

Write a simplified factoring implementation that will factor an integer:

1. Write the implementation in your language of choice, or in psuedocode
2. The implementation should be a method or function
3. The implementation should accept a single integer greater than zero as an argument
4. The implementation should print all pairs of integers that can be multiplied to produce the input integer

Validate your implementation using the following test scenarios:

| Input | Result  |
| ------ | -----: |
|  10  |  2 x 5  |
|  24  |  2 x 2 x 2 x 3 |
|  7919  |  1  x 7919|

**Trivia:**  
Data and the algorithm used to encrypt the data are considered cryptographically secure when it would take every computer on earth longer than the age of universe to break the encryption using a brute force attack.
