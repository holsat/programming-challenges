#Fizz Buzz

[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a word game used to teach children about division.

Write an implementation that will output the results of playing the Fizz Buzz game that meets the following requirements:

1. Write the implementation in your language of choice, or in psuedocode
2. The implementation should be a method or function
3. The implementation should begin the game at zero (0) and end the game at one hundred (100) (inclusive).
4. The implementation should print each number
  1. For multiples of three (3) "Fizz" should be printed instead of the number
  2. For multiples of five (5) "Buzz" should be printed instead of the number
  3. For multiples of both three (3) and five (5) "FizzBuzz" should be printed instead of the number.

Your implementation should produce the following results for the numbers zero (0) through one hundred (100):

**Trivia:**  
When playing the game players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
