#Fibonacci Numbers

[Fibonacci Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) are the numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence, which is characterized by the fact that every numer in the sequence (except the first) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

Write an implementation that will output the first ten (10) Fibonacci Numbers:

1. Write the implementation in your language of choice, or in psuedocode
2. The implementation should be a method or function
3. The implementation should print the first ten (10) numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence
4. The sequence should begin with one (1)
5. Every number in the sequence, except the first two (2), should be the sum of the two (2) numbers immediately preceding it


Validate your implementation using the following output:

| Output  |
| -----: |
|  1  |
|  1  |
|  2  |
|  3  |
|  5  |
|  8  |
|  13  |
|  21  |
|  34  |
|  55  |

**Trivia:**  
Two consecutive Fibonacci numbers appearing in sequence occurs often in nature. Examples include branching in trees, arrangement of leaves on a stem, the arrangement of a pinecone, the family tree of honeybees, and the number of possible ancestors of the X chromosome in humans.
