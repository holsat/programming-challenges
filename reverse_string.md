#Reverse String

In modern programming languages many low level functions have been included into libraries, but these libraries have not always been available.

Write a method or function to reverse the characters in a string. The implementation should meet the following requirements:

1. Write the implementation in your language of choice, or in psuedocode
2. The implementation should be a method or function
3. The implementation should accept a single string as an argument
4. The implementation should return a string with the characters of the input string in reverse order (ie, last character first)

Validate your implementation using the following test scenarios:

Input|Result
-----|------
testcaseone|enoesactset
detartrated|detartrated
drawkcabylsuoiverp|previouslybackward

**Trivia:**  
Words that read the same forward and backward are [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).
